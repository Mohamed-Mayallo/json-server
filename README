# Technical Assignment

## Installation

You can install the project either locally or via Docker.

### Local installation

1.  Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the node server:

```bash
node server.js
```

### Docker installation

If you have Docker installed on your device, follow the below steps:

1. Build the app image:

```
docker build . -t assignment --no-cache
```

2. Run the app image:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ${pwd}:/usr/app assignment
```

## Usage

After installation, follow this link:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

Then, you can test the assignment's requirements:

1. Search for a specific item
2. Create a new item
3. Update an existing item

## PS

- Keep in mind, I built this assignment as minimally as possible. You might note that I used only one dependency, `json-server`, as the assignment does not force me to follow a specific direction.
- Anyway, there are many ways I can build this task, I can use Vue, Angular, or React.
